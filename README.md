# BPL Dream 11 üèè--- [Live link](https://github.com/Abdul-Ahadexpo/Assignment-7)

Welcome to **BPL Dream 11**! This is a React-based cricket team selection app where users can choose and manage players within a coin limit, inspired by the Dream 11 concept. This project was designed as part of Assignment-07 to help reinforce React concepts and UI development skills.

## Project Description

The BPL Dream 11 app allows users to:

- Select players for their dream cricket team based on a limited coin budget.
- Toggle between available and selected players.
- Enjoy a rich user experience following a Figma design.

The app is interactive, with validation to ensure players are only added if the user has enough coins and hasn't exceeded the player limit.

## Features

1. **Navbar with Coin Display**: Displays the user's coin balance, initially set to zero.
2. **Dynamic Banner**: Users can earn coins by clicking a button in the banner.
3. **Player Selection with Coin Validation**: Users can select players based on their coin balance, with alerts if they exceed their limits.
4. **Toggle View**: Switch between available and selected players with a count indicator.
5. **React-Toastify Notifications**: For better user feedback during player selection and removal.
6. **Newsletter Section**: A subscription feature with LocalStorage to save the user's email and greet them upon revisit.
7. **Footer**: Custom footer that follows the Figma design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
